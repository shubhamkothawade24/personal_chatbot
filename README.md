# 🤖 Personal AI Chatbot (Built in 2019)

A rule-based NLP chatbot designed to answer user questions using a fixed knowledge base. Built as a prototype during the early stages of AI development, this project reflects strong fundamentals in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), and project management.

## 🧠 About the Project

This chatbot project was initiated in 2019, long before the rise of modern generative AI systems. It was designed to demonstrate how a machine can answer user queries using natural language understanding and a custom dataset consisting of personal or organizational information.

The chatbot uses classic NLP techniques such as tokenization, sentence similarity, and keyword matching to generate responses. It only answers questions that it can extract from the given knowledge base, making it reliable but limited in scope.

The main goal of the project was to understand the end-to-end process of chatbot development, from problem definition to deployment, using proper SDLC practices.
